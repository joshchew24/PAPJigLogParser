# PAPJig Log Parser
Requires pandas 1.1.4 or higher and matplotlib 3.3.4 or higher.

## TODO:
- improve parser code readability
- command line: multiple functions, can process entire folder or just single files
- graphing: more visual clarity, outputs image file OR can open in graphing viewer?
- change output folder to same directory as input 
- outputs new folder for each date



## Usage:
- can only graph .log files that have already been previously parsed
