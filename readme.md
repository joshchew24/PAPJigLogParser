# PAPJig Log Parser
Requires pandas 1.1.4 or higher and matplotlib 3.3.4 or higher.  
Accepts .log files of specific format, examples to be provided. Work has stopped for now in this repository; switched to private BitBucket repo. Once CLI refactoring is complete, this repo will be updated for probably the last time. 


## TODO:
- improve parser code readability
- command line: multiple functions, can process entire folder or just single files
- graphing: more visual clarity, outputs image file OR can open in graphing viewer?


## Usage:
- can only graph .log files that have already been previously parsed
