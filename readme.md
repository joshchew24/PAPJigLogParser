# PAPJig Log Parser

## TODO:
- improve parser code readability
- command line: multiple functions, can process entire folder or just single files
- graphing: more visual clarity, outputs image file OR can open in graphing viewer?
- chagne output folder to same directory as input 
- outputs new folder for each date



## Usage:
- can only graph .log files that have already been previously parsed
