# PAPJig Log Parser
Requires pandas 1.1.4 or higher and matplotlib 3.3.4 or higher.
Try main or develop branches. Accepts .log files of specific format, examples provided. Work has stopped for now in this repository; switched to private BitBucket repo. 
## TODO:
- improve parser code readability
- command line: multiple functions, can process entire folder or just single files
- graphing: more visual clarity, outputs image file OR can open in graphing viewer?
- chagne output folder to same directory as input 
- outputs new folder for each date



## Usage:
- can only graph .log files that have already been previously parsed
